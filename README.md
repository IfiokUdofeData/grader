# Welcome to the Grader App ðŸ‘‹

## About the Project

Grader App is an innovative mobile application designed to simplify and modernize the exam grading process. By leveraging the power of AI and image processing, this app automatically grades exam answer scripts when you take a picture of them. Whether you're a teacher, an examiner, or an institution looking to streamline grading workflows, Grader App offers a fast, accurate, and hassle-free solution.

### Key Features:
- **AI-Powered Script Recognition:** Automatically identifies and processes exam answer sheets using cutting-edge image recognition technology.
- **Customizable Grading Schemes:** Supports a variety of grading methods to cater to different marking criteria and systems.
- **Error Detection:** Highlights discrepancies or unclear answers for manual review.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for ease of use, with intuitive navigation and minimal setup.
- **Data Privacy:** Ensures all scripts and grades are securely stored and handled.

## Get Started

Follow these steps to set up and start developing the Grader App:

### 1. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the App
Launch the development environment using:
```bash
npx expo start
```

### Development Options:
After starting, youâ€™ll have several options to open the app:

- [Development Build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/): Fully compatible environment for testing all features.
- [Android Emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/): Simulate the app on Android devices.
- [iOS Simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/): Simulate the app on iOS devices.
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go): A sandbox for quick testing. Note that some native dependencies may not function in Expo Go.

**Important:** Due to the use of native dependencies, testing in Expo Go is limited. Use a development build for full functionality.

### 3. Start Developing
Begin by editing files in the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction), making navigation and component management simple and efficient.

## Advanced Commands

### Writing Native code
If you need to write a Native code for the project, locate the android and ios folders in the modules/my-modules folders and write your custom code. After adding a native code, you need to prebuild your code with any of the following options:

Building for android:
```bash
npx expo run:android
```
Building for ios:
```bash
npx expo run:ios
```
